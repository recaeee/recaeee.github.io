Hi, hello, I am 欧几里得范数, you can also call me Reca. I graduated from a certain lower-level 211 computer department in 2023. My original major was in the direction of AI, but due to my limited personal ability, I consciously did not understand AI. I also love playing games, so I chose to devote myself to the gaming field. I like rendering and want to learn all kinds of cool rendering effects.

Personally, I like painting and art. I am an 老二次元 (social horror attribute). My favorite drama is "The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya". Although I know nothing about graphics, I am very attracted to graphics and like to use computers to draw. My dream is to pass The game engine renders the scene in your mind.

Most admired games: Persona series, Granblue Fantasy Relink

Most played games: FPS games (Apex, etc.)

When you see this, why are you torn to pieces today?
